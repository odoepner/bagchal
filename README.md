Credits and code structure
--------------------------

- Originally based on code by Daniel Newman (danielnewman106@hotmail.com)
- All code was completely rewritten and reorganized
- Design Patterns : Model-View-Controller, Object-orientation
- Codebase now uses Dependency Inject Yourself (DIY) for decoupling
- What used to be an Applet is now a downloadable Swing application (jar)

Functional Improvements
-----------------------
- Added sound effects 
- Fixed flicker when dragging goats
- Theming support
- Flexible game board dimensions
- Added preliminary goat AI (work in progress)
